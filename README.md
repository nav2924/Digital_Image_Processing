# 🧠 Hair Disease Detection System using Deep Learning

A powerful and efficient Hair Disease Detection System that leverages Deep Learning (CNN), Image Processing (CLAHE), and Object Detection (YOLOv8) to classify and localize scalp-related conditions.

🌐 **Live Demo:** [Streamlit App](https://hair-health.onrender.com/)  
📦 **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/nav2924/hair-disease-detection

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Preprocessing Pipeline:** Denoising and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for image enhancement.
- 🧠 **Deep Learning:** CNN model trained on enhanced and balanced image datasets.
- 🎯 **YOLOv8 Integration:** For precise detection and localization of affected scalp regions.
- 🖼️ **Streamlit GUI:** Upload an image and instantly get predictions in a user-friendly interface.
- 📈 **High Accuracy:** Achieved through data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and robust training.
